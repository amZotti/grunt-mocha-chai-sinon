This repository is an example for [grunt-mocha-chai-sinon](https://github.com/marcopeg/grunt-mocha-chai-sinon) NPM module.

This repo represents an _NPM_ module which provides a _Math_ library capable to _sum()_ 
and _sub()_ operations. 

Of course it is an unbelievable simple piece of code but **the
pourpose here is to show how to use** the `grunt-mocha-chai-sinon` and not to write
any rocket science!

> [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/) installed globally.
